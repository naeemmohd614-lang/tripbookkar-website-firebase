/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TripBookKar Admin Dashboard.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model where only authenticated administrators
 * with a custom claim `admin: true` can read and write data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is organized into several top-level collections: `hotels`, `packages`,
 * `affiliates`, `pricingRules`, `seoPages`, `leads`, and `admin`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - **Admin-Only Access:** All read and write operations are restricted to authenticated admins.
 * - **No Public Listing:** List operations are secured to prevent unauthorized data access.
 * - **Custom Claims for Authorization:** The rules check for `request.auth.token.admin == true` to grant admin privileges.
